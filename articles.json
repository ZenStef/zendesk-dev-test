It%E2%80%99s also expensive, even if the ultimate goal is to save money. And let me repeat: Companies are going through this every five years.Of course, there are plenty of legitimate reasons you could decide to change their customer support tool. Maintaining an in-house legacy system may have become too expensive. Perhaps the vendor is no longer be supporting or upgrading your current solution. Maybe after a round of consulting and training expenses, it%E2%80%99s become clear the existing tool really can%E2%80%99t address your needs.

      "description": "Gone are the days when a customer could only communicate to your business through one-to-one channels such as mail, the phone, or in person. The conversations around your business and your customers are happening in greater numbers across an increasing number of communication channels every year. Even the channels themselves are undergoing radical change with the emergence of many more technologies like Twitter, Facebook, and customer communities that allow for many-to-many communication.We are in a world where every business must consider the impact of offering multi-channel customer support as well as what it means to not offer it. Multi-channel means all the various ways in which customers may reach you for service and support, including phone and email, but also newer technologies, including social media and lightweight self-service options such as knowledge bases, communities, and live chat tools. More and more customers are turning to these emerging technologies and expecting businesses to do the same. Amidst all of this, both email and phone still maintain a large portion of today%E2%80%99s support requests.Rather than allow the proliferation of these channels to overwhelm your customer support and service operations, you have the chance to take advantage of them and you should. Handled appropriately, they can improve the efficiency of your support organization, greatly increase customer satisfaction, and generate new sales opportunities. Mishandled or not addressed at all, you run the risk of being out of touch with modern communication channels and at a competitive disadvantage.In this paper we will explore the reality of proliferating channels%E2%80%94from the recent growth of social media technologies like Facebook and Twitter, to the habits of a younger generation of customers and where support will be going in the future.As a part of this, the explosion of mobile devices has created a proliferation of hardware channels in many support organizations. Your employees most likely have a laptop at their desk, a smart phone in their pocket, an iPad in their bag and your organization might be moving some of its work to those devices. Detaching from the desktop and working across multiple platforms%E2%80%94a desktop, iPad, iPhone, BlackBerry and\/or Android devices%E2%80%94can benefit your support team by allowing them to address tickets from anywhere.Next, we%E2%80%99ll discuss how adopting a multi-channel approach to support can actually benefit your organization and make your support team more efficient and effective. While it can be tough for any organization to open up new channels of communication with their customers, it is a bigger risk to avoid opening them. These channels offer new sales opportunities of which your competitors will surely take advantage.Lastly, we%E2%80%99ll take a look at some strategies for how you might begin a multi-channel approach, as well as offer some tips that will help your organization get the most out of this approach.Newer service and support channels do not mean that the new%E2%80%94chat, social media%E2%80%94will replace the old%E2%80%94phone and email. Instead, each channel is receiving its share of requests.In addition to the traditional one-to-one communication via phone contact center and email, customer support organizations are also encountering:While phone is still the primary channel customers use to interact with customer support departments, its predominance is decreasing along with email. Other channels, meanwhile, are growing in use. An Aberdeen report from 2009 estimates that phone and email communication has decreased from 73%25 of customer communication to 59%25 over the past two years.%0ATable 1 %E2%80%93 Reliance of Multiple Service Delivery ChannelsIt is not that phone will go away, but that the field of contact will widen into more and more channels, each with their slice of the customer conversation.Social media tools such as Facebook and Twitter are now significant channels for customer support. Almost 20%25 of people using Twitter seek customer support from a business each month, and 61%25 seek information about products or services.1 And the increase is happening in both B2B and B2C scenarios.%0ATable 2 - Volume of Social Media Interfaces (Source: TSIA Social Media Survey)In response, many businesses are actively pursuing the use of social media as a support channel, with large numbers planning to implement such solutions through 2011. The trend is clear: if you do not meet your customers where they are, your competitor will.On the hardware side, your customers and employees can do more and more on mobile devices than ever before. Whether officially sanctioned or not, many support employees already make use of their smart phones, iPads, and personal accounts like Twitter and Facebook to solve their customers problems because these channels make the support team%E2%80%99s jobs easier. Being able to access your support system from anywhere frees them from only doing support while at their desk. Agents who are meeting with clients or working in a conference room can pull out their iPad and check in with the requests coming in or create new ones right when they come up. Your response time will go down and your support will be more flexible.Rather than fight this trend, the business that sets up their support organization to work across these multiple platforms will be better able to respond quickly to the multiple channels of your customers.Add to this that customer service requests are increasing across the board and you have a situation where not only must a business contend with multiple channels they must also integrate the experience across those channels. HDI (the Help Desk Institute) found that the number of incidents reported to customer service departments via chat, e-mail, telephone, self-help systems, social media, the Web and walk-ins is rising, with 67%25 of all customer service operations experiencing increases in 2010.%E2%80%9CThere is the trend to being able to work anywhere and anytime,%E2%80%9D HDI Analyst Roy Atkinson said. %E2%80%9CAnd that requires more support, so the environment as a whole is probably more complex.%E2%80%9DThe importance of customer service and support for a business%E2%80%99s bottom line has only been increasing over the past decade as markets go global and digital. According to a recent survey by Forrester Research, 91 percent of decision-makers said elevating their customers%E2%80%99 experience was a mission-critical goal...and 68 percent planned to increase their spending in that area.2Customer loyalty is increasingly hard to maintain as more and more options and new products make it to market each year. Rather than use just price or product, companies must differentiate themselves by providing their customers an exceptional experience. Offering a great price leaves business open to being undercut offering the customer a great experience builds long-term loyalty.And yet, as Don McNair, Senior Director of Customer Interaction at Yaskawa Electric says, %E2%80%9CCustomer satisfaction is a moving target. As the customer expectations change the service and technology used to provide the service will change. In implementing the technology we believe that the customer has the choice of what technology he\/she prefers to use, so our support systems must address the customers technology of choice.%E2%80%9DIf you are not engaging customers on the channels they already use, you are missing sales. According to a report by Gartner, for instance, 57%25 of U.S. online customers say they are very likely to abandon an online purchase %E2%80%9Cif they cannot find quick answers to questions.%E2%80%9D3 By offering self-service options on their websites or a live chat service, businesses can engage that customer at the moment they need it and help them find those quick answers.Specifically, a business that adopts a multi-channel approach to customer service affords themselves many advantages.Be ahead of the curve. It is clear that the younger generations are adopting new and multiple communication channels. Those are your potential customers. As Zendesk CEO Mikkel Svane puts it, this is %E2%80%9Chow kids are communicating today. They abandon traditional channels in favor of online and increasingly social channels. The future customer will want to communicate using IM, Skype, Twitter and the like.%E2%80%9DDrive proactive rather than reactive customer conversations. Using new channels such as social media tools and online communities gives your business a chance to more proactively address customer concerns and gather feedback. Rather than sitting back and waiting for customer to come to you, these channels give you an opportunity to engage them. This can lead to very valuable feedback and goodwill not as readily available in more traditional channels.Save time and money. Offering multiple channels also gives your organization more deflection opportunities%E2%80%94moments when a customer can get the service and support they need without picking up the phone or walking through your front door. And there are cost benefits to this. In a report by Forrester Research, web chat came out at about half the support cost of a phone call, with an email being half the cost of that. Web self-service is a mere dime.4%0ATable 3 %E2%80%93 Approximate Cost of Service Channels Per InstanceAgain the point is not that offering phone service is bad, but that by having multiple channels, you provide more cost-effective measures for when those measures are appropriate. %E2%80%9CBy segmenting and directing customer requests to appropriate channels,%E2%80%9D Lori Angalich of Asutute Solutions writes, %E2%80%9Corganizations expedite access to information, while reducing the burden on more costly service-based resources.%E2%80%9D5Zendesk customer Animoto experienced this directly when they opened up a web self-service channel. Despite an increase of 300%25 to 400%25 in customer traffic to its knowledge base, the number of emails and service tickets has declined.%0AFigure 1 %E2%80%93 View of an Agent%E2%80%99s Ticket Activity in Zendesk for iPadEstablishing multiple customer support channels must be accompanied by a strategy to maintain and integrate them. It%E2%80%99s not enough to open the door if no one is there to greet them.Understandably, a company may be wary of spreading itself too thin, or of opening up the support floodgates. A company that provides multiple ways for contact raises expectations that they will be providing better service. While this is of course a good thing, your organization must live up to it.To optimize and benefit from your organization%E2%80%99s multi-channel support, you need:%E2%80%9CAs exciting and new as emerging social channels are, supporting customers via social media requires the same underlying processes as traditional channels. - John Ragsdale, Vice President of Technology Servies Industry Association%E2%80%9DIn order to be an effective support organization, you need to capture all your requests in a unified process and set of tools. The proliferation of channels discussed above can lead to a discordant organizational experience with one of your support agents checking email while another is communicating over Twitter. It is a classic problem of the right hand not knowing what the left is doing.Sadly, that is very often the case. The authors of %E2%80%9CThe Cross Channel Customer Experience%E2%80%9D report that %E2%80%9C%5Bw%5Dhile many enterprises have accelerated their implementation of select, new communication channels, very few have tied them together into a complete system of customer care.%E2%80%9D6 The result is a scattered, reactive organization, reaping none of the benefits stated above.Instead, organizations need all their channels to feed into a central tool with a unified set of business processes. While requests may arrive in different ways, the organization should treat them all the same way at some level. This will reduce overlap of efforts, ensure consistent responses, and simplify the management of your support team.How Zendesk Helps Cross-Channel Communication: Within Zendesk, each customer interaction is captured in a single ticket regardless of channel. Additionally, all the data you have on that customer, as well as their entire support history, is also easily available alongside that ticket. A customer can post a tweet that Zendesk turns into a ticket, and then turn that ticket into a live chat. All those channels are seamless for the customer while appearing as one interaction to the support agent.Zendesk as a Unified Tool: Zendesk supports multiple channels from email, chat, social media and phone and feeds them into a central ticketing system. All your interactions with a customer are captured in this ticket. You can use multiple channels to communicate but you only need one tool to manage it.Customers are often switching from one channel to another when interacting with your company. In a report on cross-channel communication, Forrester found that %E2%80%9C%5Bm%5Dore than 71%25 of customers reported that they go from the Web to some other channel when researching and buying, and 74%25 of customers said they move from the Web to another channel when getting service.%E2%80%9D8When they switch channels, it is often recorded as two separate interactions by the support organization while to the customer, it is simply one continuous experience. The confusion on the support organization side results directly to frustration for the customer. To avoid this situation, you need to lower the confusion on your end.Ensure that any data that has already been collected by the customer on your end stays with them through the whole interaction. As this is often a technology problem%E2%80%94a chat system that can%E2%80%99t talk to your ticketing system%E2%80%94it further reinforces the need for a unified tool.The important thing is to not only allow your customers to move across channels keep your channels tightly connected so that data flows easily between them.%0AFigure 2 %E2%80%93 Multiple Channels Captured in a Single Zendesk TicketWhile self-service and email support are often enough to resolve your customer support issues, supplying a live channel%E2%80%94chat, phone, or even Twitter%E2%80%94is becoming more and more important. While it seems counter-intuitive, the increase in good self-service options for customers%E2%80%94from communities to knowledge bases%E2%80%94makes live support agents more relevant, not less.Customers who cannot resolve their issue through a self-service option or the delayed interaction of email need to be able to reach a human. Otherwise they feel helpless and can direct their frustration to their friends and social networks.How Zendesk Achieves This: With Zendesk, alerts and notifications (emails, texts, Twitter DMs) can be set up to notify agents about incoming tickets and chats, as well as many other points throughout the support process. Also, Zendesk for Twitter gives you the chance to create and save Twitter searches right within the tool. You can add your industry name, your product name, anything you want to monitor. Also, any and all mentions of your Twitter handle can be automatically turned into tickets.The implication is clear: our history of the customer service desk and getting help directly needs to stay with us in this digital market. It is important to offer your customers a way to reach you immediately when they need to. It is a balancing act%E2%80%94live support can be time-consuming%E2%80%94but it is one of the most effective ways to ensuring customer satisfaction.Yet, with good self-service channels in place, as well as all your other channels, you will need less live support agents in place that you would otherwise, making multi-channel support much more cost-effective.Live and Self-Service Channels in Zendesk: Zendesk offers a native live chat feature, as well as a number of integrations with phone services. Incredibly, some large Zendesk customers who have turned on the live chat feature have seen their ratio of emails drop to 30%25 of their tickets with chat taking the bulk of the 70%25.%0AFigure 3 %E2%80%93 Support for Multiple Customers During a Live Chat Session within ZendeskWhile we%E2%80%99ve talked a lot about centralizing and integrating your multiple support channels, it is also important to realize how each channel is different and treat them accordingly.While it is up to your support organization to decide on your engagement style, it is always a combination of monitoring the channel and engaging the customer.Email, phone and chat are very reactive channels%E2%80%94your agents wait for the customer to initiate the interaction. Because of that, they require some immediate engagement from your agents. To facilitate this, alerts need to be set so the agent is notified when an email has come in, a chat has started, or a customer is on the phone.Social media channels and customer communities allow you to be more proactive. While they have their reactive components, because your organization does not own those channels, they require much more monitoring. You can create rules that notify you about conversations mentioning specific names. But you don%E2%80%99t necessarily need to engage them right away. Sometimes sitting back and listening can be more valuable.On the flip side, you also don%E2%80%99t need to wait for the customer to initiate the conversation. Your service and support organization can also post updates about your product, or initiate conversations about it.The customer experience is happening more and more on multiple channels and the savvy businesses are opening up on those channels themselves. While this can seem like one more challenge to your team, adopting a multi-channel approach to support as well as making it possible for your support team to work on mobile platforms will make your support organization more effective and better able to turn support interactions into sales opportunities.The most important thing to remember when supporting multiple channels is that you need a unified tool to do it. As channels proliferate, the need to engage in them is not only a best business practice but also a criteria for success.Want to take advantage of multi-channel support but not lose your mind doing it?

      "description": "Building a knowledge base for internal reference or customer self-help is a long-term commitment. You not only need to dedicate resources up front in order to stock it with valuable content, you have to decide how to maintain it on an ongoing basis in order to keep it relevant and up to date.Your resource allocation decision often depends on what type of product or service youre supporting and whether the complexity or level of detail will require the skills of an experienced technical writer. Whether you have the need of a technical writer or not, therell be times when an engineering approach to writing content for a knowledge base makes the most sense. Other times, that task can be part of the customer support role.A knowledge engineering approach requires subject matter experts or a dedicated technical writer or documentation team to write and review all the content before making it public. A more demand-driven approach puts the production and maintenance of knowledge in the hands of the whole team with the support agents as the driving force.The case for knowledge engineering%0ATechnical writers and experienced documentation teams are particularly skilled in making even the most complex information easier to understand, so there are certain situations where this approach is the only sensible way to go.If very high level of accuracy is important, the knowledge engineering approach is a good choice, since both accuracy and consistency of style and tone are easier to achieve with professional technical or documentation writers. Also, the content creation process tends to be more formal and thought out when it is a standalone function, and the quality of the content often reflects that fact.Another good use case for knowledge engineering is any instance in which the product or service being supported does not experience frequent or significant changes. If there%E2%80%99s not much change in the product or environment, then there%E2%80%99s no need to factor in frequent additions and updates to your knowledge articles. You can make the investment up front to hire a contract technical writer to create your knowledge base from scratch or even to introduce upgrades or new products. A good writer will be skilled at anticipating questions before they come and can help you seed the knowledge base with great articles that will stand the test of time.The case for demand-driven knowledge%0ADemand-driven knowledge, on the other hand, integrates content creation with your support process. It accepts that knowledge is always changing and improving, and that%E2%80%99s reflected in the way knowledge base articles are written and improved over time.For example, agents search for known answers in the knowledge base when they%E2%80%99re working a support ticket if they don%E2%80%99t find an answer, they create a new knowledge article. If they do find a relevant article that%E2%80%99s out of date or incorrect, they fix it on the spot or change it to %E2%80%98draft%E2%80%99 so it can be reviewed and updated.Naturally, not everyone on your team will have an affinity for writing help articles, so keep articles in draft or internal-only mode until they can be reviewed by another team member.Two key components of a successful demand-driven approach are:Through experience and ongoing coaching from capable team members, you%E2%80%99ll see improvements in the quality of internally produced articles from your support staff. As you identify the agents that write the best help articles, you can promote them to Help Center manager roles, so they can directly publish their content to your self-service portal.The case for having it both ways%0AIn many cases, a blend of these two approaches works best. Your technical writer can produce the customer-facing articles, while your support team collectively owns and manages the internal knowledge base. By analyzing search results, you%E2%80%99ll know which internal articles are used most frequently. With just a little editing, these most-used articles are great candidates for external publication, driving an increase in ticket deflection.Whichever approach you take to creating your self-service content, encourage your support agents to search the whole knowledge base (including the community) for known answers before spending time and effort to rediscover each solution all over again.What%E2%80%99s your documentation process?

      "description": "Phone support is the black sheep of today%E2%80%99s multichannel support world. Poorly trained staff, misguided processes and confusing phone systems have eroded the user experience and given phone support the reputation of being irritating and ineffective for consumers.However, research shows that consumers prefer phone calls to other channels because they feel acknowledged and receive faster resolution. Yet in spite of the studies, many small and medium businesses (SMBs) have shied away from offering phone support because complex legacy phone systems require expensive hardware and lengthy professional setup, and are tough to scale as business and support needs grow. They%E2%80%99ve yet to realize the truth%E2%80%94that advances in Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology are making phone systems far more affordable and easier to set up and manage.In short, phone support is a vital and practical part of a multichannel support strategy.This paper touches on common misconceptions around phone support and delves into the surprising research that shows why it%E2%80%99s so important for SMBs. It then describes how to implement a call center in minutes, using an integrated VoIP system, and covers best practices for tracking and analyzing phone support effectiveness.Most people have nightmare stories of hopelessly attempting to navigate an interactive voice response (IVR) menu, or getting stuck on hold for 30 minutes while an upbeat voice regularly assures them that their %E2%80%9Ccall is very important.%E2%80%9D IVRs, hold music and complex menus are all intended to help callers navigate the support process, yet they often have the opposite effect. Combine a confusing process with poorly trained, unempowered and often outsourced staff (as is the case at many large call centers), and you have a recipe for a poor user experience.For SMBs evaluating phone support%E2%80%99s potential, these customer horror stories are exacerbated by complex legacy phone systems with implementation processes that require expensive equipment and lengthy professional setup. Poor user experience and difficult implementation? It%E2%80%99s easy to see why many SMBs see phone support as a last resort.Unfortunately, many large phone support organizations focus on minimizing downside rather than maximizing delight, which is why phone support is often arduous. A McKinsey Quarterly article exemplifies this strategy through its findings at a wireless telecommunications provider, which after rigorous analysis, %E2%80%9Cconsidered raising service levels to the delight breakpoint or reducing them to just above the patience threshold. Customer-lifetime-value economics pointed to the second option1.Yet for SMBs, which don%E2%80%99t often encounter the same volume-related challenges that large organizations face, delighting customers can be a powerful weapon in the fight for market share. Great service helps create brand advocates%E2%80%94loyal customers who evangelize a company%E2%80%99s product(s) to others. Brand advocates help businesses drive loyalty and growth without increasing sales and marketing spending. When combined, sales and marketing spending averages five times more than customer-retention spending2.Further, a Deloitte study shows that brand advocates are more profitable than average consumers, spending more than twice as much on average3. In this sense, providing exemplary service can help SMBs realize measurable returns on their customer support investments.But in order to create brand advocates, companies must first reach customers on their channel of choice.A 2011 customer support study by callcentres.net and Forrester Consulting found that phone conversations trump email interactions nearly three to one, with 44 percent of those surveyed listing %E2%80%9Cphone conversation%E2%80%9D as the most often used communication method in the prior three months, compared to just 15 percent for email4. The same study also found that 79 percent of those surveyed listed voice conversations among their preferred channels, while only 33 percent listed email%E2%80%94the second most popular channel.%0APhone conversations are both more popular and preferred over other customer support channels. (Source: Forrester Consulting)To explain these preferences, the Forrester Consulting study asked respondents to prioritize what they desire in a customer service interaction. Quick resolution and human interaction topped the list:It%E2%80%99s clear that consumers believe phone calls are more efficient and empowering than other channels. Indeed, many issues benefit from a conversation%E2%80%99s delay-free response. An internal Zendesk customer support study confirms these findings, showing that phone calls reduce the number of interactions per issue by 17 percent.As useful as it can be, phone support alone isn%E2%80%99t the answer to increasing support efficiency. It%E2%80%99s one part of a multichannel strategy that includes digital and social channels such as email, Web forms, Twitter%C2%AE and others.Effective phone support is simple and intuitive to use, and resolves issues quickly. Attaining this kind of operational efficiency requires a blend of empowered staff and intelligent tools working together to keep conversations moving and ensure that agents never skip a beat. Here%E2%80%99s how it operates:Phone support can and does operate this way for many SMBs. With new technology lowering the price, simplifying setup and management, and helping integrate phone calls with other channels, it%E2%80%99s easy to achieve an ideal operation with few setup headaches.There are four key steps to implementing a phone support operation:There are three main phone system types:Legacy systems aren%E2%80%99t well suited to SMBs because they require expensive hardware and professional setup, and they don%E2%80%99t scale easily as businesses grow. VoIP systems are more flexible because of Web delivery, and they require no hardware beyond a computer and headset. However, traditional VoIP systems lack one key component: customer support software integration.Recently developed integrated VoIP systems link phone calls to customer support software to close the loop on customer interactions. Calls are logged in tickets and attached to customer profiles, making it easy to cross-reference a new call with all old conversations%E2%80%94phone, Web or otherwise. These systems help agents log information and resolve issues without worrying they%E2%80%99ll forget something. Further, they offer:If possible, find a system with a free trial and no up-front commitment to avoid being locked in to a suboptimal solution.With the right phone system, setup requires only a few clicks of the mouse and no outside help. Once it%E2%80%99s ready, but before you start taking calls, there are a few things to establish:Focus on making the customer experience as simple and straightforward as possible. If you use menus, limit options to only those that are absolutely necessary for ensuring proper call routing. Let friends and employees test the process before pushing it live to customers.It%E2%80%99s important not to overwhelm support staff when trying phone support for the first time. A one-month trial period divided into two-week phases can work wonders for first-time organizations.Phase 1 - Opt for a slow rollout to a handpicked set of customers by emailing them a short message about the new service. Use this first period to ease staff members into the support process. Conduct weekly meetings and seek feedback from both staff and customers. Evaluate their feedback and tweak the process accordingly before the second phase.Phase 2 - In the second half of the trial period, take a closer look at issue type and volume using the phone system%E2%80%99s reporting dashboard. Use this information to gauge staffing needs based on the number of customers you hope to support.Which customers should you support? - This is a crucial decision that depends largely on business goals and product type. For example, consumer-goods businesses typically support all customers via phone, whereas service companies may only allow a certain customer subgroup because problems are more complex.Announcing support should be done via email and, if all customers will receive support, by posting the number on your website and in regular customer communications. Be prepared - Zendesk saw a 40 percent increase in weekly calls after posting our support number to our site.Once support is live, it%E2%80%99s important to track KPIs to ensure that everything is running smoothly and detect troubling trends. The phone system%E2%80%99s reporting dashboard should aid this process by keeping track of a few key stats, including:For first-time users who are unfamiliar with these stats, start slowly. Use basic call volume and average call time to ensure appropriate staffing, and then revisit the more advanced stats after a few months.The ultimate measuring stick for phone support is customer satisfaction, so find ways to gather feedback whenever possible. Great phone systems and help desks will provide a simple electronic feedback mechanism, but it may be necessary to seek more advanced methods, such as callback or email surveys. Remember to ask for improvement opportunities to spot easy ways to increase customer satisfaction. As trends emerge, prioritize the correction and improvement options and implement the ones that make sense.We live in a fast-paced, multichannel world where customers who have issues with products or services expect immediate responses. Phone support is an ideal tool for SMBs looking for ways to increase customer satisfaction and drive word-of-mouth marketing. With new technology simplifying implementation, lowering costs and merging channels into a centralized dashboard, any business can offer first-class support faster than ever before.Zendesk Voice is a simple VoIP solution that integrates with our award-winning customer support software.

      "description": "Social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter have evolved to become more than emergent platforms for marketing and advertising. Increasingly, they are also valid and important channels through which consumers solicit and receive customer service. According to Nielsen%E2%80%99s 2012 Social Media Report, nearly half of U.S. consumers use social media to ask questions, report satisfaction, or to complain%E2%80%94and a third of social media users prefer %E2%80%9Csocial care%E2%80%9D to the phone.%E2%80%9CSocial care%E2%80%9D is not a new concept, yet providing%C2%A0multi-channel support that includes social media can present real challenges for B2B and B2C companies both large and small%E2%80%94as well as opportunities to positively impact sales and customer loyalty. The reality is that%C2%A0customer service expectations are rising year over year and consumers are looking to brands to create a seamless experience that spans the showroom floor to the Facebook timeline. Simply having a social media presence is no longer enough you need to be a social media rock star.But how? In this guide we%E2%80%99ll explore some best practices for providing great customer service through social media, whether you%E2%80%99re just getting started or taking your social care to the next level.One of the first challenges to providing great customer service over social media is determining where to focus time and resources. While marketing efforts may drive traffic to targeted social sites, customer service teams must meet their customers where they%E2%80%99re already socializing. For most companies, Facebook and Twitter will be the primary focus for social care, but some brands may find that their customers also frequent Google+, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Instagram, or other social sites.To figure out where your customers are, search for mentions of your brand within popular social sites. Whether this is a first step toward creating a social media presence, or something your marketing department has already done, it is a mistake to leave dialogue about your brand solely to online commenters and the Google search algorithm.If you find that customers aren%E2%80%99t yet talking about your brand online, look for ways to include yourself in conversations relevant to your industry. The way to be welcomed into social conversations is to add something of value.Because the consumer%E2%80%94not the brand%E2%80%94wields the most power over a brand%E2%80%99s image on social media, the bottom line is that neglecting conversations that occur on sites like Facebook and Twitter can have staggering consequences. Conversocial reported that 88 percent of consumers are less likely to purchase from a company that leaves questions on social media unanswered.Many marketers are already familiar with social media monitoring tools that automate the process of searching for mentions of a brand name, or combing social media pages for specific keywords, but listening is equally important from a customer service perspective. What%E2%80%99s more, many customers already believe that you are. When participants in a 2012 survey from Oracle were asked what was most important when visiting a company%E2%80%99s social media page, 43 percent responded that they were looking for a direct response to their question, followed by 31 percent who expected direct access to customer service reps.Depending on how much volume your brand%E2%80%99s social media pages generate, it%E2%80%99s important to collect and analyze customer activity so that you understand the kind of issues being raised over social media. Smaller companies may need to collect a week or month%E2%80%99s worth of activity while larger companies can probably take a pulse over a shorter period of time.Look at the information you%E2%80%99ve collected to determine:The answers to these questions will help you plan staffing and resources, define priority criteria, make decisions about self-service options, and determine whether you%E2%80%99ll be able to handle the majority of issues directly through the social channel or require a process for directing social customers to another line of support.There are tools that automate the process of calculating volume and time, and can generate reports to provide you with a complete picture of customer demand. You may learn, for example, that the hours your customers are most active on social media do not align with your actual support hours.The size of your company and industry vertical will affect your social metrics. Some companies will see a lot of what amounts to %E2%80%9Cnoise%E2%80%9D via social media, and their challenge will be to sift through the noise to find the top priority contacts that require a response. Other companies will find that the majority of their contacts are direct requests for customer service. Depending on the volume of social interactions your brand generates, and the size of your staff, your ability to keep track of social inquiries (and your responses) may be made easier by a customer service platform that can integrate with social media and turn posts, tweets, and direct or private messages into tickets. In this way, you can easily triage, track, and escalate issues behind the scenes, yet still respond to the customer in the space where they have contacted you.As a best practice, it%E2%80%99s not necessarily wise to simply turn every social media mention into a ticket, either because your company%E2%80%99s social media pages are so heavily trafficked that the volume becomes unwieldy, or because every interaction does not require a response (sometimes customers are perfectly adept at responding to each other). Still, what an integrated, multi-channel customer service platform can provide is context. The more you can see about a customer%E2%80%99s history, the better. Are there open or prior conversations with this customer? Who did they interact with, and what was the outcome? Have they had this same issue before? Have they already tried reaching customer support through traditional channels or was Facebook their first line of defense? If you already have user data stored, agents can eliminate back-and-forth questioning for basic (or private) contact data.In the fast-paced world of social media, speed of response is critical. Treating social media tickets like any standard ticket isn%E2%80%99t going to be enough because customers expect a faster response. So, how can you define priority criteria? There%E2%80%99s no single way to do it, of course, but here are a few suggestions:Highest priority:Items that are second-tier in priority are often opportunities to be proactive. You might consider:Smaller businesses without a need for a customer service platform might try one built specifically for social media ticket creation and management (rather than phone, email, and chat support) or, at the very least, utilize the private or direct messaging features of Facebook and Twitter to help create an archive of interactions with a customer.Its worth restating: speed of response is critical.%E2%80%9CLive help%E2%80%9D typically refers to phone or chat support, yet in the customer%E2%80%99s mind, social media is a gray area that more closely straddles the line between chat and email support. There is the potential for help to be instantaneous if social media is constantly monitored, but more likely, help will arrive hours later.Several studies have found that the majority of customers expect a response over social media within the same day. That%E2%80%99s pretty reasonable considering Edison Research reported that 42 percent of consumers who complained via social media expect a response within 60 minutes, and, according to the Oracle survey, more than half of Twitter users expect a response within two hours of tweeting at a company%E2%80%94both of which can be difficult service levels to meet, though some companies are beginning to.One of the challenges to providing social care when you%E2%80%99re not using the follow-the-sun model of support, is that tweets and timeline posts can languish overnight, driving your response time from just a few hours to 10-20 hours later.As a best practice, always respond with immediacy%E2%80%94or with the promise of. This can be tricky without being able to send an email autoresponder, but one workaround is to prepare a boilerplate message catered to each social channel that lets the customer know you%E2%80%99ve seen their comment and that you%E2%80%99re working on a resolution.Speed isn%E2%80%99t everything if you%E2%80%99re not able to resolve the customer%E2%80%99s issue. As a general guideline, if you can easily answer a question posed over social media in the space of a comment or tweet, and the answer can be public, then by all means, do it. But more important than providing an answer through the same channel it was asked, is providing a timely and correct answer. This might involve providing a first response over social media that moves the conversation to another channel of support.The success of your social care efforts will depend, as ever, on the quality of care you provide, but you might want to pull out the kid gloves because providing great customer service over social media can require extra special handling. Agent responses must be timely, accurate, sensitive, brief, and friendly%E2%80%94a tall order.Agents must respond quickly but not so fast that the issue isn%E2%80%99t properly resolved. Agents must employ their soft skills to read into a customer%E2%80%99s emotional state and properly determine when the informal nature of social media, such as the use of smiley faces or emojis, are appropriate for conveying friendliness and willingness to help, or when a more formal statement of empathy or apology might be required before addressing the customer%E2%80%99s issue.Then there is the issue of length. Can or should the issue be resolved publicly, within the limited real estate of a comment or tweet? Is the agent trained in, or capable of, drafting custom replies without errors? Popular myth suggests that the young and tech-savvy are best equipped to handle social media, but some large companies have reported success using seasoned customer service agents, trained specifically for social media.In general, all tenets of excellent customer service apply to social media. A great response will:Active use of a site like Twitter can be an acquired taste%E2%80%94and a learned skill. Consider hosting a %E2%80%9CLunch and Learn%E2%80%9D or equivalent to cross-train your staff on social media usage and etiquette. Often at smaller or newer companies, there is overlap between marketing and customer service, but as companies grow, shared skill sets, best practices, and communication guidelines tend to break down and become siloed. Cross-training will ensure that your teams learn from one another, and that your brand message and integrity are upheld at every point of customer interaction.Once agents are trained at responding over social media, they have the potential to be more efficient, handling four to eight times the number of contacts received through social media as they can by phone, according to a report by Gartner. In addition to improved efficiency, it was also reported that providing excellent social care helps to foster a deeper emotional commitment to your brand, directly impacting your Net Promoter Score.Providing a public response to a question or complaint can go a long way. According to Conversocial, 95.6 percent of consumers are affected by other customer comments on a brand%E2%80%99s social pages, and so it follows that consumers will also be affected by your responses to questions they see raised over social media.When you gain or lose customers based on customer service, it adds up in dollars. The good news is that, as reported by Bain and Company, social media users spend 21 percent more when they experience excellent customer service.But the reality is that not every contact over social media can be easily resolved in a single exchange (or in less than 140 characters), particularly if the issue is very technical or when the customer has many grievances to air. It can also be hard to know at the outset whether the customer will keep a thread going, cluttering your Twitter feed with @replies, so customer service reps must become adept at determining when to take a conversation from a public page to a private message, or perhaps off social media altogether%E2%80%94as well as when to bring the exchange back into the public sphere.Generally, agents should move a conversation %E2%80%9Coffline%E2%80%9D%E2%80%94in this case, off a timeline or feed\/stream\/profile%E2%80%94when:But how to do it? Sensitive information that can be quickly conveyed in writing may easily be sent in a private or direct message through the social media site. The following are based on a few real world examples of how one company used Twitter to request information, suggest another channel, and move a conversation into a private message:@Customer My sincerest apologies! I would be happy to look into this for you. Can you please follow us and DM me with your order #? %5ESB@Customer So sorry for those emails! If you need help w\/ your email settings, dont hesitate to LiveChat us%5Bbit.ly\/link%5D %5ESB@Customer Apologies for the inconvenience! I just reached out to you via Facebook Message. Be sure to check your %E2%80%9COther%E2%80%9D folder. %5ESBOne benefit to using a customer service platform that integrates both social and traditional channels is that you can use social media to let the customer know you%E2%80%99ll send them the information they need by email, without having to request the customer%E2%80%99s email address.After an issue is resolved offline, it%E2%80%99s important to return to the social channel and thank the customer for reaching out. Public interactions can be a double-edged sword, but the positive ones, when a customer has the chance to express gratitude for a great customer experience, is not the interaction to miss out on.In our 2013 Omnichannel Customer Service Report we learned that customers default back to phone and email support in almost even numbers when they don%E2%80%99t receive a response over social media. While that doesn%E2%80%99t sound too bad, the report also found that 76 percent of conversations between customers and brands ended completely after the brand suggested the customer switch channels to either email or phone.While building a social media support strategy, it%E2%80%99s worth considering what might happen if you moved every social interaction %E2%80%9Coffline%E2%80%9D or to another channel of support. Companies with %C2%A0limited staffing and resources might find that they must, and when done well, the customer will feel like they received a response over social media and had their issue resolved.We%E2%80%99re all familiar with that old adage, %E2%80%9CWhen life gives you lemons...%E2%80%9D The well-known implication is that it%E2%80%99s possible to turn around a less-than-hoped-for situation with a change in attitude. This is particularly useful advice when providing customer service over social media, given consumers%E2%80%99 proclivity to use social media to grab a brand%E2%80%99s attention. A recent survey by the Center for Services Leadership at Arizona State University, in conjunction with Customer Care Measurement  Consulting, found that 50 percent of consumers will complain to a brand about a bad experience, and that 35 percent of Americans are using Facebook, in particular, to complain about a shopping experience.When this happens, everything depends on your response. Receiving negative feedback is an open invitation to rectify your brand%E2%80%99s image and, more important, your relationship with the customer. The customer must feel like they%E2%80%99ve been heard and that you%E2%80%99re willing to do what it takes to make them happy.The following are some other things customer service reps might do to proactively to engage customers:Whatever the social channel, there are a few ways to (publicly!) stick your foot in your mouth. The following are a few social media don%E2%80%99ts:There are, of course, always a few exceptions to the rule, and here%E2%80%99s one of them:Regular monitoring of your company%E2%80%99s social media pages combined with savvy use of the sites can elevate your customer service efforts from acceptable to exceptional. The better your social care, the more social traffic you can expect, and this is a good thing!Looking for more information about using social media for customer service?
